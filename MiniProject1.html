    <h2>Who is a Web Developer?</h2>
    <p>
      A Full Stack Developer is a software engineer with comprehensive skills in
      both the front-end (what the user sees and interacts with) and the
      back-end (server-side logic, databases, and infrastructure) of a web
      application or software project. They can work on the entire software
      development lifecycle, from designing user interfaces to managing
      databases and deploying the application, enabling them to build and
      maintain complete projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Full Stack Developer's role is to work on both the front-end (user
      interface) and back-end (servers, databases, logic) of web applications
      and platforms. They design, develop, and maintain complete applications
      from start to finish, handling everything from the visual presentation to
      the underlying infrastructure to create seamless user experiences.
